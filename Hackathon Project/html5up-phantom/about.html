									<p>Welcome to Pawnder, where we're dedicated to creating lasting bonds between pets and their forever families. At Pawnder, we understand the importance of finding the perfect match for both pet and owner. Our mission goes beyond just facilitating adoptions; we're committed to reducing animal returns by ensuring that every adoption is a well-informed decision. Through our platform, prospective pet parents can browse through profiles of adorable animals awaiting their forever homes. But our commitment doesn't end there. We provide comprehensive resources and educational materials to empower pet owners, ensuring they have the knowledge and support needed to provide a loving and nurturing environment for their new furry friends. Join us in our mission to lower animal returns and promote responsible pet ownership.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Our goals for this website were to ensure the choice to care for an animal is a sure decision. Seven to twenty percent of adoptions end in an animal being returned to the shelter. This can put emotional stress on animals. THe large surplus of animals in shelters also causes roughly five to eight million euthanasias a year. This can cause vetinary technicians to feel depressed. Our goal is to reduce the emotional turmoil animals without homes can cause.</p>
